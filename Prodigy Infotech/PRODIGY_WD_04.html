        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I'm a Passionate and skilled front-end web developer, eager to master the art of web development. As a recent graduate, I bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to every project. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at Rajalakshmi Engineering College, affiliated with Anna University, Chennai, with an expected graduation in 2024. My educational journey began at Jaigopal Garodia Vivekananda Vidyalaya, where I completed both my Higher Secondary and Secondary School education. Throughout my academic career, I have honed a diverse skill set including programming with C, front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, UI/UX design using Figma, MySQL database management in XAMPP Web Server, and version control with GIT. My project experience includes developing the TRI Thermo Bottle, a unique project that allows storing three different liquids at three different temperatures, creating a responsive e-commerce website for #TAG Cosmetics using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designing an IoT-based Childrenâ€™s Home Safety Protection System. I have also actively engaged in continuous learning through various courses and workshops such as an 8-week online Web Development program from Internshala Trainings, a 14-day UI/UX Design workshop from Growthschool, a GIT Tutorial course from Great Learning Academy, and a 5-day CSS bootcamp conducted by Codekaro............</p>
